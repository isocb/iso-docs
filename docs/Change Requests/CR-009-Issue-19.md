**Description:**

You have created the simply billiant support centre. I would like to enable this - there is an ticket creation form. I would like to enhance this data with deduced user meta data, logged in role &amp; module, like that we used for tooltip creation. Can you enable ticketing please. The exisiting screens are great. I would prefer to use the core app for this, as it gives us the multitenant , muti module framework without having to apply it to zendesk etc... I want simplicity!!

CRUCIAL ISSUE: When the platform owner creates a support ticket for a client, it must be possible for the platform owner to have an input on the form for Tenant and User as well as Module. The form for users should also have module on it for clients (they may have multiple modules so easier to just have a drop down of all available modules for them to indicate what the ticket relates to. The add ticket modal will not save.
