**Description:**

The + next to tags doesn't seem to have added the tag, - it's certainly not on the drop down in the modal. Also: Need to have a bulk method for changing status.... suggest a check box (to the left of the row, so it can be clicked NB whole row clickable to open edit - as per UI, but check box must be clickable: select all, or select individually to create a collection - then select update - eg from Draft to Pending...

**Description:**

When clicking a filter for status, I would like to be able to (for example) identify all live issues - ie not complete. This can be acheived by having multi select. Default filter should exclude completed. - ie check all of the status options in the multi select. The filter can then be refined by removing some of the default selects.
