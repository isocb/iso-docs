**Description:**

When opening 'Client tab', there is a list of clients - perfect. Clicking a client there is a brilliant transition now which is an animated transition to a sub set of tabs and a great specific client management screen. Clicking Users tab on this view gives a list of users in a table which does not conform to the UI specification in this document: https://github.com/isocb/docs/blob/8127c423ea7f381c3936e74030f6f3b47e804bd1/docs/00-overview/isostack-ux-ui-standard.md
