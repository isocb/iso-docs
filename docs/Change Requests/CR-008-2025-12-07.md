### Sidebar collapse icon position

**Issue #16** | **ID:** `cmivg5x06001i10vmytkbfs69`
**CR #8** | **CR ID:** `cmivg641g001n10vmuutydnjk`
**Perspective:** PLATFORM_OWNER
**Category:** Refinement | **Priority:** Medium
**Tags:** SideBar
**Modules:** CORE

**Description:**

Can the sidebar icon collapse be grey can the stroke be 1 Can the icon be positioned on the right hand side of the sidebar when it is open, with a similar optical spacing to the left icon spacing used for menu items that are ranged left. the Expand Icon shoulld be closer to the right hand of the edge of the closed navbar... please,

**Resolution:**

✅ **Implemented** - 2025-12-07

**Changes Made:**
1. Icon color changed to grey (`color="gray"`)
2. Icon stroke weight set to 1 (`stroke={1}`)
3. Positioning logic updated:
   - **When sidebar is open (expanded)**: Icon positioned on right side with optical spacing (`justify="flex-end"` + `pr="xs"`)
   - **When sidebar is closed (collapsed)**: Icon centered and closer to edge (`justify="center"` + no padding)
4. Smooth transition added for position changes (200ms ease-in-out)

**Visual Result:**
- Open state: Icon aligned right with consistent spacing matching left-aligned menu items
- Closed state: Icon centered in narrow 80px sidebar, visually closer to edge
- Grey color provides subtle, non-intrusive appearance
- Thin stroke (1) maintains clean, minimal aesthetic

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`

### Tenant Isolation

**Issue #15** | **ID:** `cmivegl9h001a10vmmmtdftnd`
**CR #8** | **CR ID:** `cmivg641g001n10vmuutydnjk`
**Perspective:** CLIENT_ADMIN
**Category:** Bug | **Priority:** Critical
**Tags:** Tenant Testing, Help System
**Modules:** CORE
**Created:** 2025-12-07T07:27:12.294Z
**Created By:** Chris - Platform Admin

**Description:**

Creating a toolttip. The 'Scope' inheritence' modal form field input should be deduced from the user role when the user is not platform owner... only platform owner can add global. Module should be deduced from where the tooltip is geing generated - because the trigger point is one the element hard coded as a possible trigger point and so the sytem can deduce this. There fields are therfor redundant for users other than platform owner. The data is relevant and the system should deduce the meta data and complete these fields with the tooltip. This is important in the UI so the system can generate the help screens at a later date which will be driven by tooltip content.

**Resolution:**

✅ **Implemented** - 2025-12-07

**Changes Made:**
1. Added `useAppBranding` hook to TooltipEditor to detect active module context
2. Auto-deduced scope based on user role:
   - Platform owners: Default to GLOBAL (can change to APP_OWNER or TENANT)
   - Regular users: Automatically set to TENANT (cannot change)
3. Auto-deduced module from active context (`activeModule.slug` or 'core')
4. Hidden Scope and Module fields for non-platform owners
5. Replaced with read-only badges showing deduced values:
   - Scope badge: "🏢 Tenant (Your Organization)"
   - Module badge: Shows active module name (e.g., "Bedrock", "Core Platform")
6. Helper text explains auto-detection: "Automatically detected from current context"

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner UI for tenant admins (no confusing fields)
- Enforces tenant isolation at UI level
- Prevents accidental creation of wrong-scope tooltips
- Module detection ensures tooltips are properly categorized
- Maintains full flexibility for platform owners

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/features/tooltips/TooltipEditor.tsx`
