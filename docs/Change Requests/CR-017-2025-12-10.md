The modal form should also contain edit fields for the Status, the Role of the User and Delete User button.

### Filter issues defines the content for 'Create Change Request' Export.

**Issue #31** | **ID:** `cmivulpac0001jw9kyr0ha8fx`

**Modules:** CORE
**Created:** 2025-12-07T14:59:04.643Z
**Created By:** Chris - Platform Admin

**Description:**

Create Change Request Export button. I would like to select the content for this in one of 2 ways: First: the bulk selection check boxes. If there are selected fields, Second: The filter that has been applied. In issue manager there are filters at the top of the table of issues. I want to apply those filters to the export content of 'Create Change Request' Export. Currently the export is of all pending items. This is limiting for me because I want to work ond development features, fixes and development: Ideas dont flow as a logical development batch and so by filtering by my tags, I can batch CR's together into a CR document, and flag the issues as in progress.

**Discussion:**

- **Chris - Platform Admin** (12/10/2025, 6:08:23 AM):
  This is not working. I want to be able to create exports for purposes other than briefing the AI. There are a number of filers that filter the view of the data on screen - I need the output .md file to obey the on screen filter rules please - both for Export and for Create CR.
