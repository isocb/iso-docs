**Created By:** Chris - Platform Admin

**Description:**

I would like to be able to set email addresses in the platform settings and in the app settings, there should be n number of emails - in a table with add email record. The email record will have data fields as follows: - name - email address - Category* - Email Signature Categor is the same category as the support ticket category, and the support ticket category will determine the recipient of the ticket notification: The platform will cascade upwards. If an email is required the pattern with be Module Category email address if empty, use platform email for that category, if empty, use the default platform email address.... so tickets are routed if available but if not, they fail safe and will always be directed somewhere. So there may be none, one or more email addresses for the platform - and separately for each module. When an email is required to be sent by for example the creation of a support ticket, In Platform Settings, there is an accordion for 'Email' This is where email addresses will be added to the platform, support in the enum

**Description:**

The perspective would be more helpful if it were a multi Select. for example an issue might be form the platform owner but it could impact on platform owner and Client Admin for example. This field actually should be 2 fields: 'Logged in Role' and 'Impact on' From this you get much improved context - "So this problem manifests when logged in as [Client Admin] and Impacts [Client Admin, Client User] Can this be done without losing my existing issues. I know if you do a prisma update it can wipe my data.....
