**Description:**

Saving an issues - it is changed from the user defined status to 'Draft' I manually changed all issues to pending, to create the change request document. The stause on them all was reset to draft, - should be set to in progress!. The output document only has one issue on it. Status filer in the UI is not working - likely issue - multiple satus fields or some implementation issue Critical: There is some sort of clever anticipation of status on the right hand of the issue rows that changes the status: Please remove this.
