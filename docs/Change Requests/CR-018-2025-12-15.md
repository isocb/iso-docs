**Description:**

When the Client Admin invites a user from settings&gt;users, the app should create a user with the status 'Pending' their acceptance - and the ability to resend the invitation. The Edit user is not triggered from clicking the row as per the UX/UI Document - Edit and delete icons unnecessary. Please remove the icons and make the modal obey the modal edit form. The modal form should also contain edit fields for the Status, the Role of the User and Delete User button.
