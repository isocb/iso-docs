**Created By:** Chris - Platform Admin

**Description:**

Create Change Request Export button. I would like to select the content for this in one of 2 ways: First: the bulk selection check boxes. If there are selected fields, Second: The filter that has been applied. In issue manager there are filters at the top of the table of issues. I want to apply those filters to the export content of 'Create Change Request' Export. Currently the export is of all pending items. This is limiting for me because I want to work ond development features, fixes and development: Ideas dont flow as a logical development batch and so by filtering by my tags, I can batch CR's together into a CR document, and flag the issues as in progress.
