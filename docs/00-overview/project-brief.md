Floot-Bedrock is a legacy app and its database is reference only.
Bedrock 3.0 will be a new module inside IsoStack with a new schema.
We are not mapping the old DB into Prisma; we are only using it to inform the design.

❗ Any docs describing direct Prisma mappings to the Floot-Bedrock tables are ARCHIVE / REFERENCE, not implementation tasks.
