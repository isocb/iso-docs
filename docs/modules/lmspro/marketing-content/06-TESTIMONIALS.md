## Case Study: East Midlands Youth Football League

### Overview
| Metric | Before LMSPro | After LMSPro |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Registration time | 6 weeks | 2 weeks |
| Admin hours/week | 15+ hours | 3-4 hours |
| Late registrations | 40% | 8% |
| Email volume | 200+/week | 50/week |

### The Challenge
East Midlands Youth Football League manages 85 clubs and nearly 400 teams across multiple age groups. The league secretary, Sarah Thompson, was spending 15+ hours per week on administration during peak registration periods.

Key challenges:
- Multiple spreadsheets with version control issues
- Chasing clubs for team information via email
- Manual data entry leading to errors
- No self-service option for clubs
- Committee members couldn't access information without asking Sarah

### The Solution
The league adopted LMSPro Professional in January 2025.

Implementation included:
- Migration of existing club and team data
- Configuration of age groups and season structure
- Training session for committee members
- Rollout to clubs with online registration

### The Results

**75% reduction in admin time**
Sarah now spends 3-4 hours per week instead of 15+.

**Registration completed in 2 weeks**
Clubs submit online, automated reminders chase stragglers.

**80% reduction in late registrations**
Clear deadlines and automated reminders keep clubs on track.

**Committee visibility**
Age group managers can now see their own teams without asking Sarah.

**Club satisfaction**
Positive feedback from clubs who appreciate the self-service portal.

### Quote
> "The time savings alone justified the cost immediately. But beyond that, the stress reduction has been life-changing. I actually look forward to registration season now."
> — **Sarah Thompson, League Secretary**
