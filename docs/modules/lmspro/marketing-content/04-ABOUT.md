## Our Story Section

### Section Headline
**Why We Built LMSPro**

### Story Content

It started with a spreadsheet. Then another. Then another.

After years of running youth football leagues with spreadsheets, paper forms, and endless email chains, we knew there had to be a better way.

We looked at existing solutions. They were either too expensive, too complicated, or built for professional sports – not grassroots football run by dedicated volunteers on tight budgets.

So we built LMSPro.

**Purpose-built for grassroots football.** We understand that league administrators are often volunteers juggling day jobs, family commitments, and a passion for youth sport. Every feature in LMSPro is designed to save time, not create more work.

**Simple by design.** No complex training required. No IT department needed. If you can use email and the internet, you can use LMSPro.

**Affordable and fair.** We believe every league deserves modern tools, regardless of size or budget. That's why we offer a genuinely free plan – not a limited trial, but a permanent option for smaller leagues.

## Mission Section

### Section Headline
**Our Mission**

### Mission Statement (large, prominent)

> To help volunteer league administrators spend less time on paperwork and more time on the football that matters.

### Supporting Text

We believe:

- **Volunteers' time is precious** – Every hour saved on admin is an hour back with family or at the pitch
- **Technology should simplify** – Not add complexity to already demanding roles  
- **Data belongs to leagues** – We're custodians of your data, not owners of it
- **Fair pricing enables access** – Cost shouldn't be a barrier to better tools
- **Grassroots football matters** – It develops children, builds communities, and creates lifelong memories

### Section Headline
**What We Stand For**

### Value Cards (3 columns)

**🤝 Built for Community**
We're not building for shareholders. We're building for the volunteer league secretaries, club officials, and administrators who keep grassroots football running.

**💡 Simplicity First**
Every feature goes through one test: "Would this confuse a busy volunteer?" If yes, we rethink it. Powerful doesn't have to mean complicated.

**🔒 Trust & Transparency**
Your data is yours. Our pricing is clear. We don't do hidden fees, surprise charges, or shady data practices. What you see is what you get.

**🇬🇧 UK-Focused**
We understand UK football structure, FA requirements, and safeguarding regulations. We're not adapting an American product – we're building for British grassroots.
