## Problem Section

### Section Title
**Running a League Shouldn't Feel Like a Second Job**

### Pain Points (with icons)

**📧 Endless Emails**
Chasing clubs for team lists, contact details, and registration forms. Inbox chaos every September.

**📊 Spreadsheet Nightmares**
Multiple versions, outdated data, manual updates. One wrong cell ruins everything.

**⏰ Weekend Work**
Your Sundays spent on admin instead of watching matches. It doesn't have to be this way.

**📋 Paper Chaos**
Forms, signatures, approvals scattered across folders. Where's that registration from three weeks ago?
